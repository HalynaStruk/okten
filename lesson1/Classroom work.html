<h1>Dune</h1>
<p>
    In the year 10191, when faster-than-light travel is possible, and almost all the planets in the known universe are colonized, Duke Leto of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV to replace House Harkonnen as fief rulers of Arrakis. Arrakis is a harsh desert planet and the only source of "spice", a valuable substance that bestows its users heightened vitality and expanded consciousness.
